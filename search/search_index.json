I have a soft spot for Tiddlywiki but have not yet committed to it in a big way. I felt the same this time - I got my digital garden up and running, but I didn't feel the urge to commit to it. I did however discover Tiddly desktop, which is a game changer for Tiddlywiki in my opinion, and avoids the need for awkard save routines or browser plug ins. Next, I looked at Gatsby, which seems to be the platform of choice for many digital gardeners. I successfully got one up and running on a local server, and my main stumbling block was adding pages successfully. For reasons unknown, setting up and linking to some pages worked fine, and yet the same method for other pages resulted in an error message. This is the kind of thing I like to sink my teeth into and solve, but on this occasion I was short of time. In any cases, I was curious to try MkDocs, since the fact it is built from markdown documents opens up the possibility of maintaining and adding pages from the iOs environment. As it turned out, MkDocs was the simplest of the three and I was soon up and running with this site, hosted on GitHub.","title":"Creating my digital garden"},{"location":"digital-garden/#creating-my-digital-garden","text":"My first attempt at creating a digital garden was with Tiddlywiki.
