# Current areas of interest

## General interests

In no particular order, these are the things that are interesting me at the moment: 

- Social norms course - ([Coursera: Social Norms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/norms)). This course is aimed at the level of wider society, particularly in developing countries, but it is easy to see at least some relevance not only to our own society but also to understanding the motivations of people in organisations.
- Embedding business change practices within an organisation - required change is not always one way. 
- The buddhist practice of cultivating inner joy that is not predicated on external influences. 
- Understanding more about social issues - equality, racism, society.
