# Welcome to my digital garden


This is not my [blog](https://jennyfaulkner.com) but a digital garden. 

A digital garden is an area to cultivate and prune ideas before they become a full, polished blog post. Better explanations are given by [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden).

As [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) says: if a note seems confusing or badly developed, it's probably because I didn't write it for you. These notes, whilst public, are works in progress. 

There's no real navigation - the posts are linked to each other to form a network of thoughts, but a starting point is my [current focus](current.md).
